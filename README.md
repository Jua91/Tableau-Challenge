## Analysis

### 1. Number of Records
Total number of records were 12 billion. People seem to ride more bikes in the summer than in the winter. The possible reason could be that people are not willing to ride outside in winter due to the cold weather.
September 2019 had the lowest number of records, while April 2020 had the lowest number of records.

Rush hours(8:00 and 17:00-18:00) seem to be the peak hours for riders.
In the summer, more people ride bikes in the evening than in the morning, but in the winter, more people ride bikes in the morning than in the evening.
